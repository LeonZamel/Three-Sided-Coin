# Three-Sided-Coin
Physics simulation for finding the optimal diameter of a three-sided coin.

Video by Matt Parker for further information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qqPKKOU-yY

## Instructions
Works with Python version 3.5

Needed dependencies are numpy, pybullet, and pandas

Additionaly for the visualization you'll need to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)


Edit the parameters in "Three-Sided Coin.py" and then run
```
python "Three-Sided Coin.py"
```

## Examples
Some diagrams showing the probability of the coin landing on its side for multiple different parameters
